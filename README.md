# Multivariate Analysis for US Solar Energy Potential - Project 2019
This is a part of our school project in exploring rooftop solar energy potentials in U.S. using a variety of Multivariate Analysis techniques (principal component analysis, clustering/segmentation ...).  
The data was collected and generated by National Renewable Energy Laboratory.   
The main purpose of this analysis is to identify regions of the United States with higher potential for adopting rooftop solar energy PV technology on low-income families and its characteristics.
